SVG-Edit extension. It requires no server contact, 100% client-side.

SVG-Edit: http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit

Issues: https://github.com/asyazwan/ext-sozi/issues

Note:
- If you have XML/rendering issues, most likely it's the sanitize.js stripping your tags. See sanitize.js.example on how to add custom tags or https://github.com/asyazwan/ext-sozi/wiki/Sanitize-Whitelist
- This extension IS NOT compatible with InkScape's. I imagine it's not hard to make it work, but I don't use it and so have not been motivated to do so. Patches are welcomed of course!
